# BondingFi

Smart contracts implementing ERC-20 continuous tokens based on multiple bonding curve formulas.

## What is a Continuous Token?

Continuous tokens are a type of token where their price is managed by a bonding curve formula. Their supply is unlimited
and the price is deterministically and continuously calculated meaning that the buy and sell prices increase and
decrease based on the amount of tokens being in circulation. Furthermore, tokens can be purchased or sold
instantaneously due to the bonding curve formula which acts as an automated market maker (AMM).
